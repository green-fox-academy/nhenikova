//Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods
// as the Person class, and has the following additional
//
//fields:
//previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
//skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
//methods:
//getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
//introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from
// previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."
//skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
//The Student class has the following constructors:
//
//Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside
// the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
//Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female,
// previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0
